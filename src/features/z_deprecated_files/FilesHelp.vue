      <p>Here is a short explanation of the different folder permissions.</p>
      <p>
        Once you click on a folder you can see its permissions in the permission
        table. Those permissions always relate to the folder that is open.
      </p>
      <p>There are 3 different kind of permissions.</p>
      <p>
        Let's start with the simple one first: 'read_folder'. With this
        permission the specified group can access the files of the folder and
        download them.
      </p>
      <p>
        The second one: 'write_folder' allows the specified group to upload and
        delete files within that folder.
      </p>
      <p>
        Both permissions 'read_folder' and 'write_folder' apply to all children
        of the source folder. A group that has the 'write_folder' permission for
        the top level folder can upload and delete files in every subfolder.
      </p>
      <p>
        The last permission 'see_folder' says that the specified group can see
        the folder name. But it can not see any files only the subfolder that
        leads to the source of the 'see_folder' permission.
